# Tar Heel Shared Reader

A prototype for the shared reader project.

This started life as the output of create-react-app, then I added the
changes from https://github.com/mobxjs/create-react-app-mobx and
further added bits from https://github.com/mweststrate/state-routing-blog-sources to get a little demo that includes react, mobx, and
integratng routing/url updates. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

I generated the placeholder images here with:
```for word in $words; do imggen -fs 48 -t $word -s 256x256 -ds 0 -bg '#99badd' -fg 'black'; done```
